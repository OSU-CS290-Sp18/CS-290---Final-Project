# Geo-Cacher

**Demo during finals week**

## Basic Description
This website serves as a community driven Geocache repository for keeping track of different geocaches around the world. Geocaching is an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called "geocaches" or "caches", at specific locations marked by coordinates. Our website will allow users to add new locations, view a list of existing locations, and see a google maps of where that location approximately is. Users will be allowed to leave comments about a location chronicalizing their experience at the location or asking the community questions about it. Coordinates will be easily obtained for use with your gps reciever.
