# Geo-Cacher

**Demo during finals week**

## Basic Description
This website serves as a open source un-regulated Geo-Cacher. Anyone on the internet can recommend a specific place by specifying the longitude and latitude of the location. People can then leave comments about the location, thereby helping the community learn about the specific place.
